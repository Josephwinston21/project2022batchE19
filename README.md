VIRTUAL NETBANKING SYSTEM USING ADMINISTRATIVE MODULE


# About the Project

A computer-based Banking system is designed to handle all the primary information required to calculate monthly statements of customer account which include monthly
statement of any month. Separate database is maintained to handle all the detailsrequired for the correct statement calculation and generation. This project intends to
introduce more user friendliness in the various activities such as updating records,maintenance, and searching. The searching of record has been made quite simple as
all the details of the customer can be obtained by simply keying in the identification oraccount number of that customer. Similarly, record maintenance and updating can also be accomplished by using the account number with all the details being automaticallygenerated. These details are also being promptly automatically updated in the master file thus keeping the record absolutely up-to- date.
